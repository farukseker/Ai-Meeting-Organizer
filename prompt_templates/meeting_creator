!input_variables:chat_messages_text,time_detail
You need to extract meaning from a conversation between a user and an AI and detect a potential meeting.
Try to find the following fields: the subject of the meeting, the date, the participants, and their email addresses if available.
If the conversation indicates that the meeting has already been agreed upon and confirmed by the parties, do not create a new meeting.
However, if no agreement has been reached yet — meaning the user has not accepted the meeting — then generate a potential meeting.
If you're going to generate a potential meeting, extract any important notes if available; otherwise, set it to None.
I’m sharing with you the JSON structure of a meeting. You must always return the result as a JSON object.
Here is the chat history:
{chat_messages_text}
I’m also sending you the current date and time — use it to determine the timing and assign an exact date. The date must be in date format.
Here is the current date and time — day, month, year, day of the week:
{time_detail}
DO NOT FORGET:
If the AI and the user have already agreed and confirmed the meeting, then is_ready must be set to False.
Here is an example of the JSON meeting output:
{{
    "title": "string or null",
    "notes": "string or null",
    "email": "string or null",
    "date": "date or string or null",
    "time": "time or string or null",
    "is_ready": true or false
}}
